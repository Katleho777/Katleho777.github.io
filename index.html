        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>My name is Katleho Neo Thabang Letsabo, I am currently in my early thirties and I am a very introverted person but in the right crowd I an be a bit extroverted. I enjoy my alone time and my own space as I feel more secure and free. I like listening to music in most genres and dancing. I enjoy video games and anime a lot as it keeps me calm and entertained at all times bring some form of calmness into my life and relaxation. I have always been into studying and improving my knowledge; always seeing each day as a learning period. I studied LLB at the University of the Free State so I am well versed in legal matters and regulations. I play the guitar on a beginner level. I am now currently learning program development for Capitec Bank Limited. So for now, that is all I will say about myself as there is always a lot that a person can share but rather keep it a mystery or not share everything all at once to keep the suspense.</p>
